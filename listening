your head, so look through the each question in the time you are given so that
you have the idea what to write. Try to predict the next question while you are
listening the conversation. for example in the first section test takers often
listen to names, place, numbers. have a look at the question in time provided
and work out what needs to go in the space whether it is a number? or a name?
or an address.</div>
